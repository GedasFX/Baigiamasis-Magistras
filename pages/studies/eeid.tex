\section{Case Study: eeID}

The Estonian Information System Authority has created TARA - a gateway for public sector services to integrate eID authentication easier and cheaper \cite{tara-business}. It is heavily inspired by the OpenID Connect \cite{tara-technical} protocol to communicate between the service and relying parties.

The Estonian Internet Foundation has then created the eeID service - a clone of TARA, but with the intent to open it up for private businesses at a premium \cite{eeid}.

These services' goal is to use domestic eID providers (ID cards, Mobile-ID, and Smart-ID) and act as a gateway to the eIDAS node network.

Cross-border authentication supported by these schemes extends (or will soon extend) to the notified countries \cite{eulaw-eidas-notified}. Currently notified countries (in order of time notified) include Germany, Italy, Croatia, Estonia, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, Portugal, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Slovakia, Latvia, Denmark, Lithuania, Malta, France, and Sweden.

At the time of writing, TARA does not support the eID schemes of the last three - Malta, France, and Sweden, and cross-border authentication is only in the planned state for the eeID service and is currently not supported.

\subsection{Authentication Protocol}

The underlying data transfer protocol used by eeID is almost identical to OpenID Connect code flow \cite{tara-technical, oidc}. One irregularity exists between the OIDC spec and eeID, which makes the whole flow non-compliant to the spec \cite{tara-non-oidc-compliant}, which we will get back to in a later chapter. Otherwise, the flow is identical. A high-level overview of this flow can be seen in figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow}. It consists of seven main steps:

\begin{figure}

    \end{call}
  \end{sequencediagram}
  \caption{OIDC code flow used in TARA/eeID}
  \label{fig:oidc-code-flow}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initial log-in. Preparation for redirect to the eID provider and generation of secrets.
  \item Redirection to the eID provider.
  \item Authentication. Users log in with the chosen authentication scheme (ID card, Mobile-ID, Smart-ID, eIDAS).
  \item Redirection back to the Auth server.
  \item Browsing session verification. Check if the request came from the same browser. This step is required to protect against CSRF attacks.
  \item Token acquisition. The Auth server exchanges the received code for an identity token containing the user's information.
  \item Signature verification. Verify the authenticity and validity of the received token. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Trust Anchor}

One of the main advantages of using eeID is the simplicity of integrating multiple sources of eID (ID card, Mobile-ID, Smart-ID, and eIDAS) with a single API. To accommodate this, eeID acts as an intermediary service, reading and reprocessing identity data to create a standardized response. With this approach, there are two issues: confidentiality and integrity.

Confidentiality issues occur whenever users do not wish to share their personal information with more parties than absolutely required. For example, if a user wants to authenticate with Smart-ID, only two parties should be involved: the company user is trying to log in to (WorkAuth) and the Smart-ID service provider (SK ID Solutions). With the inclusion of eeID service, another entity is added between them that has full read and write access to the data.

Integrity issues are caused by having that full access to the identity data. Should the eeID service get compromised, attackers could impersonate anyone in all services relying on eeID.

Companies should keep these risks in mind when integrating the eeID identity provider.

\subsection{Pricing}

The operational cost when using the eeID identity provider is nine cents per successful authentication \cite{eeid-pricing}. It is the highest price among all identity providers and does not have tiers. A thousand successful authentications would cost WorkAuth 90 â‚¬.

\subsection{Security Requirements}

The TARA/eeID documentation has an in-depth integration guide and the validation requirements clients must implement \cite{tara-technical}. Additionally, RIA claims that the protocol used is mostly OpenID Connect compliant. Because of this, we can have two resources to validate the resilience of the architecture - TARA docs themselves \cite{tara-technical} and IETF's OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice document \cite{ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}.

\paragraph{Communication channel}

The eeID service uses a secure communication channel, encrypted end-to-end using HTTPS. When the system is integrated correctly, malicious clients (or user agents) have no possible way of influencing any of the authentication parameters without causing any validation failures later on.

\subsubsection{Requirements for the Identity Provider}

OpenID Connect specifies three different flows - code, implicit, and hybrid \cite{oidc}. In code flow, all sensitive tokens are handled via backchannel - a secure communications channel between the eID solution provider and the relying party where the user client is not involved. The implicit flow is the opposite - a user agent receives the identity token from the eID solution provider and sends it directly to the company's authentication server, which validates the authenticity of this token. A hybrid flow is a mixture of the two. Security experts consider the code flow to be the safest option of the three \cite{ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}. Coincidentally, it is the only supported flow by TARA and eeID \cite{tara-technical}.

\paragraph{Replay attacks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item eeID will reject the second POST /token request with the same code.
\end{itemize}

The developer does not have to implement internal state management to verify that a given code was used only once. When combined with other countermeasures available, a replay attack becomes impossible to execute by any practical means. Mitigation measures provided by the eID solution provider are sufficient.

\paragraph{Insufficient Redirect URI Validation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Changes in the registered OIDC application undergo manual verification by eeID employees and do not allow for wildcards.
\end{itemize}

The manual verification process is sufficient to mitigate this attack; it is impossible to test if countermeasures exist on the client registration interface used by the eeID service employees. Mitigation measures provided by the eID provider are adequate.

\paragraph{Credential Leakage via Referrer Headers}

\begin{itemize}
  \item eeID does not include third-party resources (javascript, image, or other); therefore, it cannot leak any query parameters to third parties.
  \item The company is required not to have any third-party resources on the authentication and redirect pages.
  % \item The client is using a secret API key, rendering it impossible to obtain private information without its use.
\end{itemize}

The eeID service does not leak credentials to third parties anywhere on their log-in page (all resources used in their service are from their domain, see figure \ref{fig:eeid-leakviareferrer}). No mitigation measures are required.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{eeid/leakviareferrer}
  \caption{The eeID service does not use resources outside of their domain in the authentication flow}
  \label{fig:eeid-leakviareferrer}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Credential Leakage via Browser History}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Replay attacks are mitigated against, the only form of attack possible with this.
  \item The {form post} response mode is not supported. Not required, but it would prevent this form of attack completely.
\end{itemize}

 Attackers can obtain authorization code, nonce, and state from the browser history (see figure \ref{fig:eeid-leakviahistory}); however, for them to be able to use codes, the relying party must be susceptible to CSRF attacks. Mitigation measures are sufficient only when CSRF mitigation is in place.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{eeid/leakviahistory}
  \caption{Authorization code is leaked inside the browser history when using eeID authentication}
  \label{fig:eeid-leakviahistory}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Authorization Code Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The use of state parameter prevents CSRF, but not code injection attacks. Because the state is not bound to an authorization code, an attacker can perform a high-tech attack (such as MitM) and inject their code into someone else's user agent or steal someone else's code.
  \item The eeID service optionally supports the OIDC nonce parameter, fixing the injection attack. When a company redirects the user to the {authorize} endpoint, a nonce parameter will be bound to the given code response. After the relying party receives the identity token, they can check if the nonce parameter matches the one sent initially. If they are not, an attacker likely has injected a session token.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{sequencediagram}
    \newthread{A}{User Agent}{}
    \newinst[3]{B}{AuthServer}{}
    \newinst[3]{C}{TARA/eeID}{}

    \begin{call}{A}{1. login()}{B}{3xx Redirect}\end{call}
    \begin{call}{A}{2. authorize() [client\_id, redirect\_uri, response\_type, scope, \textcolor{red}{nonce}, \textcolor{red}{state}]}{C}{Auth Page}\end{call}
    \begin{call}{A}{3. login()}{C}{3xx Redirect + [code, \textcolor{red}{state}]}\end{call}

    \begin{call}{A}{4. loginCallback()}{B}{Auth token}
      \begin{call}{B}{6. token() [client\_id, client\_secret, redirect\_uri, grant\_type, code]}{C}{id\_token \{ \textcolor{red}{nonce}, \dots \}}\end{call}

  \end{sequencediagram}
  \caption{CSRF/Code injection mitigation in OIDC code flow}
  \label{fig:oidc-code-flow-code-injection-mitigation}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow-code-injection-mitigation} illustrates this mitigation well. Because an attacker does not have access to both authentication requests (1 and 4), they would be unable to influence either nonce or state. If the relying party validates the integrity of both nonce and state, mitigation measures are sufficient to protect from both CSRF and code injection attacks.

\paragraph{Clickjacking}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The eeID service's auth page does not use Content-Security-Policy, however it does use header X-Frame-Option: {DENY} (see figure \ref{fig:eeid-responseheaders}).
  \item Relying party should integrate this or a similar countermeasure.
\end{itemize}

Mitigation measures are sufficient on almost all browsers released in the last ten years \cite{caniuse-xframeoptions}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{eeid/frameoptions}
  \caption{Response headers browsers receive when opening the eeID service's login page}
  \label{fig:eeid-responseheaders}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Requirements for the Relying Party}

In the previous section, we saw the security features of the protocol. The relying party should implement validation and reject requests for some of the features if those validations do not match. This section will contain all of the features the RP needs to address.

\paragraph{Misconfiguration Attacks}

\subparagraph{Incorrect OpenID Configuration}

The relying party should make sure to use the correct OpenID Connect discovery document. For test environment the URL is \url{https://test-auth.eeid.ee/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration}, and for production - \url{https://auth.eeid.ee/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration}. A connection with a malicious party could be established when using the incorrect URL.

Developers should make sure these values are not easily editable (such as placed in environment variables) by anyone â€” best, hardcode them in the application.

\subparagraph{Weak TLS configuration}

TLS is the primary defense mechanism against MitM attacks when connecting to the eeID servers. WorkAuth's IT Ops team should ensure that the server does not trust any malicious CA.

\paragraph{Authorization Code Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery}

The primary validation user has to implement is protection against CSRF and code injection. Developers can accomplish this by using the state and nonce parameters of the protocol.

\subparagraph{Attack description}

For reference to how the mitigation works, we will use the figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow-code-injection-mitigation}. We will provide three examples for the countermeasure: no state and nonce, strong state and nonce, and strong state and nonce. Because eeID and TARA both require sending the {state} parameter, for this example, we will use a weak constant state string, such as "x".

Our attack exists on the third step of the OIDC code flow - right after the user agent receives the redirect response but before they are redirected. An attacker can stop a request by changing the victim's firewall settings to block the WorkAuth servers and would be able to extract the authorization code from the browser history. This attack, however, is just a single example of countless similarly creative attacks.

\subparagraph{Attack \#1 - No state and no nonce}

After the user agent gets redirected, the attacker can extract both code and state. If no session binding is performed, they can use the URL themselves and authenticate with the victim's identity.

\subparagraph{Attack \#2 - Strong state without nonce}

This attack is similar to the first example but with the introduction of user agent session binding. The relying party, before they redirect the user agent (step 1 response in figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow-code-injection-mitigation}), would issue a cookie on who's value the state parameter depends. An example would be to have a session token, a regular 32-byte random string, and the state parameter would be an {SHA-256} hash of that string. Attackers would not be able to reverse the hash to fabricate the cookie, and if the server, when validating the request, notices that the hash of the session cookie does not match the state, it would reject the HTTP request.

A way to circumvent this for attackers would be to use two sessions. Attackers would create a session with the relying party and wait for a victim. The victim creates a session, gets redirected, and authenticates. After the victim tries to return, the attacker stops them, takes only their authorization code, and puts it in their request. When the relying party validates the request, it would see that the attacker's cookie's hash matches the attacker's state parameter.

\subparagraph{Attack \#3 - Strong state with nonce}

To protect against authorization token injection, the relying party must bind the user agent session to the state parameter and the identity token (the result of consuming the authorization code). The relying party can achieve this by using the nonce parameter.

In step 6 of figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow-code-injection-mitigation}, we see that if we use the nonce parameter, additionally, we receive a nonce value in the identity token. This value exactly matches the one sent in the initial {authorize} request (step 2). If we store nonce and state inside of a user agent cookie, we can see that this prevents the previous attack, as it required victims to create a session themselves, and by doing so, they would generate a nonce that would be different than the attackers. Unlike the state parameter, they do not know what nonce was used and are unlikely to guess.

If the attackers manage to guess the nonce, they would also be required to update their user agent cookie. For {relying parties} to protect against this attack, they can encrypt this cookie to prevent external tampering.

\subsection{Integration}

The best way to integrate the eeID service would be to use existing OpenID Connect implementation options. Cloud hosting giants Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure offer an easy way to incorporate an OIDC provider (see figures \ref{fig:addoidc-aws}, \ref{fig:addoidc-azure}). Alternatively, there are many officially certified services and libraries developers can use \cite{oidc-certified}.

This thesis will use Microsoft's official ASP.NET Core library \cite{ms-auth-oidc-src}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{eeid/addoidc-aws}
  \caption{Adding OpenID Connect provider to Amazon Web Services}
  \label{fig:addoidc-aws}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{eeid/addoidc-azure}
  \caption{Adding OpenID Connect provider to Microsoft Azure}
  \label{fig:addoidc-azure}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Manual integration} If, for any reason, the use of libraries is not available or acceptable, developers can integrate the OpenID Connect protocol themselves. They do not have to integrate the whole protocol, just the code flow. For reference, we will use the source code from the {.NET} library \cite{ms-auth-oidc-src} and the TARA documentation \cite{tara-technical}. The steps listed will be as seen in figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow}.

\subparagraph{Login}

This step is all about user agent session binding and {authorize URL} generation. This is a multipart section so each part will be split into its own paragraph.

For the {authorize} endpoint URL generation is best to look at chapter 4.1 of TARA documentation \cite{tara-technical}. There are, however, some notes to keep in mind when integrating the eeID service:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://auth.eeid.ee/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration} contains all of the necessary information to realize which endpoints to use and what values are currently accepted.
  \item \url{https://test-auth.eeid.ee/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration} contains the configuration for the eeID test environment.
  \item {response\_type}: the only flow supported by TARA/eeID is code flow, so this value can only be code.
  \item {nonce}: although not required, it protects against authorization code injection attacks and should be used whenever possible \cite{ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}. See the previous chapter for more details.
  \item {ui\_locales, acr\_values}: these fields are non-standard, and most, if not all, libraries will not support them out of the box. For most use cases, these values can be left empty.
  \item {code\_challenge, code\_verifier}: Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is not supported, {nonce} should be used in its place.
  \item {response\_mode}: not supported, therefore only response mode of {query} can be used.
  \item {nonce, state}: both nonce and state have the exact behavior (see Discovered Weaknesses section for more information).
\end{itemize}

With this information, we can extrapolate a working {authorize} request (see listing \ref{lst:eeid-authorize}).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The eeID service authorize endpoint request}, label={lst:eeid-authorize}]
  GET https://test-auth.eeid.ee/oidc/authorize?

  client_id=oidc-b0669946-896b-4cdf-a478-a60afd5c18a5-20&
  redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.eid.gedas.dev%2Fsignin-tara&
  response_type=code&
  scope=openid&
  nonce=CWWLeSzn5tyu3XCSUTIz_BQJgnFxu7US&
  state=J5BpaPNynnbhZCWmDlCZc5QWznVyIfebYGkZ3...
\end{lstlisting}

Before redirecting the user to the {authorize} endpoint, it is essential to bind the nonce and the state to the user agent session. We accomplish this by attaching an encrypted cookie to the response, which the user agent will save before it gets redirected.

\subparagraph{Authorize and Second log-in}

When the user agent redirects the user to the eeID service authentication page, they can choose any authentication option. This process is not relevant to the thesis.

\subparagraph{Callback: verify state}

After the user finishes authentication with the eeID service, they are redirected to the redirect\_url defined in the request with particular query parameters (see listing \ref{lst:eeid-authorize-callback}). Note the inclusion of nonce, as this value should not be here \cite{okta-oidc-spec} (see Discovered Weaknesses section), and we will ignore it for the rest of this section.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The eeID service authorize redirect response}, label={lst:eeid-authorize-callback}]
  GET https://auth.eid.gedas.dev/signin-tara?
  
  code=OC-106-2hUkp91Z2acDYJF7PUFjDoTJKkHncVYl&
  nonce=CWWLeSzn5tyu3XCSUTIz_BQJgnFxu7US&
  state=J5BpaPNynnbhZCWmDlCZc5QWznVyIfebYGkZ3...
\end{lstlisting}

The WorkAuth's server's first step is to verify if the state received in the callback matches the one stored in the user agent session. If it does not, it was a possible CSRF attack, and the process should end here.

\subparagraph{Callback: acquire token}

Once the authorization server that the state matches the user agent session, it is safe to exchange the received code for an identity token. See listing \ref{lst:eeid-token} for a request example.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={The eeID service token request}, label={lst:eeid-token}]
  POST /oidc/token HTTP/1.1
  Host: tara.ria.ee
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
  Authorization: Basic b2lkYy1iMDY2OTk0Ni04OTZiLTRjZGYtYTQ3OC1hN-jBhZmQ1YzE4YTUtMjA6aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS9kUXc0dzlXZ1hjUQ==

  grant_type=authorization_code&
  code=OC-106-2hUkp91Z2acDYJF7PUFjDoTJKkHncVYl&
  redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fauth.eid.gedas.dev%2Fsignin-tara
\end{lstlisting}

The inclusion of redirect\_uri here may be confusing. It is required as per the OAuth2 spec (section 4.1.3) \cite{rfc6749} and prevents open redirection attacks when using wildcards. The eeID service does not appear to allow them, so the inclusion of this value is redundant; however, if it were excluded, the protocol would no longer be OpenID Connect compliant.

\subparagraph{Callback: verify token}

In the unlikely event the token endpoint request failed, it could mean a sophisticated replay attack could have taken place. If an access token was already issued for that code, it must be immediately revoked. Another way for the request to fail would be if the client or user agent took too long to be redirected. If the token endpoint returns a faulty result, the authentication process should stop.

If the token endpoint returns the identity token successfully, the user should validate its authenticity. If the nonce parameter was used in the first request, the server should verify that nonce in the user agent session matches the one in the id\_token. The rest of the verification should be done as described in the TARA documentation \cite{tara-technical}.

\subparagraph{Issue access token}

After the server verifies the identity token, issue a new access token with the necessary information from the identity token. The most common solution would be to create a new cookie and attach it to the response.

\subsection{Discovered Weaknesses}

\subsubsection{Incorrect Implementation of at\_hash}

In the TARA Technical Specification \cite{tara-technical}, the identity token has at\_hash value that is not according to the OIDC spec \cite{oidc}.

When looking at the id token response, it has a property at\_hash with the value of {X0MVjwrmMQs/IBzfU2osvw==}. This value is supposed to be base64url encoded. Instead, it is a regular base64 string. The Demo REST Client example provided by the same authors \cite{tara-demorest} correctly converts the base64 value into the base64url encoded value, which leads us to believe that there is a mistake in the documentation and or implementation. If it was following the specifications of the TARA documentation and not OIDC spec, it should have no reason to do so.

The eeID service follows the TARA documentation, and because of that, the at\_hash uses base64. An issue arises when the using OpenID Connect libraries (see listing \ref{lst:ms-oidc-at-hash}).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols.OpenIdConnect fails to validate at\_hash}, label={lst:ms-oidc-at-hash}]
  IDX21348: Validating the 'at_hash' failed, see inner exception.
  IDX21300: The hash claim: 'UtsKV8+hA/bB0EE/xR9cCQ==' in the id_token did not validate with against: 'AT-95-VU6Y2LZjrNrVCdhlEaCxG6Gpzt0RsE-Z', algorithm: 'RS256'.
\end{lstlisting}

If we compute the hash manually, we see precisely why the verification failure happens (see listing \ref{lst:athash-manual}). The implementation expects a different string than was provided. The same transcoding behavior is seen on the TARA Demo Client \cite{tara-demorest}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Verifying at\_hash manually}, label={lst:athash-manual}, language={bash}]
  user@localhost:~$ access_token="AT-95-VU6Y2LZjrNrVCdhlEaCxG6Gpzt0RsE-Z"
  user@localhost:~$ echo -n $access_token | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | head -c 16 | base64
  UtsKV8+hA/bB0EE/xR9cCQ==
  user@localhost:~$ echo -n $access_token | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | head -c 16 | base64 | tr '/+' '_-' | tr -d '='
  UtsKV8-hA_bB0EE_xR9cCQ
\end{lstlisting}

The implication of this discovery means that all working clients who use eeID have incorrect OpenID connect implementation. This issue affects only those who use the correct OpenID Connect implementation libraries.

The reason for the incorrect implementation stems from backward compatibility \cite{tara-non-oidc-compliant}.

\subsubsection{Confusing state and nonce Behavior}

OpenID Connect specification does not mention that state should be transferred over to the id\_token. TARA confused the purposes of state and nonce properties, extended the behavior to cover each other, and, by extension, made one of the properties obsolete.

The state property is part of the underlying OAuth2.0 specification, where it is an "opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback" \cite{rfc6749}. The primary security feature is to prevent CSRF attacks \cite{rfc6749,ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}.

The nonce property is part of the OpenID Connect specification, and its primary purpose is to prevent replay attacks when using implicit or hybrid flows \cite{oidc}. Later, researchers discovered that it could also protect against authorization code injection attacks with the code flow. The disadvantage of using {nonce} as a state parameter is that it directly influences the size of the id\_token, which should be kept as small as possible. The reason for keeping this token as small as possible is so that developers could later send them in request headers to their resource servers \cite{rfc7519}. The only issue is that these tokens expire after 40 seconds and cannot be refreshed \cite{tara-technical}, making this approach impractical.

If we look at the data flow diagram (see figure \ref{fig:oidc-code-flow-wrong}), we see that both state and nonce have each other's properties. After the user agent returns to the callback URL, both {nonce} and {state} are returned when only {state} is required. After the company's authentication server establishes a backchannel and redeems the code for an id\_token, this token again contains both {nonce} and {state} when only {nonce} is required.

In the security analysis performed last year, a researcher suggested removing the nonce parameter from the protocol \cite{tara-security-arnis}. We disagree with this approach and would suggest removing the state parameter from the id\_token response. Removing the nonce parameter and having no support for PKCE would break OIDC compliant libraries' ability to mitigate authorization code injection attacks.

\subsubsection{Wrong Claims in the OpenID Connect Discovery Endpoint}

The discovery endpoint provides all information about possible requests and responses. The data listed there does not match the documentation. For example, in the discovery endpoint for eeID (\url{/oidc/.well-known/openid-configuration}), claims like gender are present, even though this claim can never appear inside of the identity token. On the flip side, the claim profile\_attributes, as described in the documentation, is missing from the discovery document.
