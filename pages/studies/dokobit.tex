\section{Case Study: Dokobit}

\subsection{Background}

Dokobit \cite{dokobit}, trademark and subsidiary of Estina \cite{euipo-dokobit}, offers two products: Document Signing Portal and API solutions.

The first product, the Document Signing Portal, was released in 2014 \cite{dokobit-aboutus}. The primary purpose of this solution is to allow users to upload documents and digitally sign them online.

The second product, API solutions, targets businesses in a variety of scopes: signature collection, signing, identification, sealing, and TSP monitoring \cite{dokobit}. In the thesis, we will only consider the Identification service.

Dokobit's Identification service allows Lithuanian, Latvian, Estonian, Finnish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Polish, Belgian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian \cite{dokobit} users to authenticate themselves with their countries' scheme.

The company has received ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certification \cite{dokobit-certification} and in 2020 was included in the EU Trusted Service List \cite{eu-trustservices, dokobit-aboutus}, thus it becoming a Qualified Trust Service Provider.

In 2021, the Norwegian electronic identity solutions provider company Signicat AS acquired UAB Dokobit.

\paragraph{Dokobit Identification Service}

Identification service supports two distinct data flows: Gateway and API. The core difference is that the Gateway uses a prebuilt UI hosted on Dokobit servers. In contrast, the API requires the companies to develop their UI and have their server communicate with Dokobit servers instead. This difference only affects the user experience.

The main advantage of Identity Gateway over Identity API is the added brand trust. A study finds that users "associate higher security feelings with a higher level of brand trust" \cite{ha2004factors}. If an organization has not matured yet as a brand (such as a recent startup), it will make more sense for them to choose Identity Gateway over API. On the contrary, if they are a large, highly trusted organization, such as a bank, it would make more sense to use Identity API and have all user interactions happen on the same domain.

For this thesis, we will only analyze the Identity Gateway.

\subparagraph{Embed or Redirect}

Identity Gateway comes in two user flows: embedded and redirect-based.

In embedded flow, users could stay on the website, authenticate in a pop-up window or frame, and update the website view accordingly after finishing the authentication process. This flow has the advantage of not requiring the users to leave the website, which is helpful to preserve user data in complex forms.

In redirect-based flow, users are sent to an external website, perform authentication, and redirected back to the company website, similarly to OAuth2.0.

Ultimately, experts consider the embedded flow to be the weaker of the two methods \cite{auth0-universal-vs-embedded} for two main reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cross-origin requests are inherently more dangerous, allowing for MitM and CSRF attacks;
  \item The client application, even when embedded, receives full client credentials, which adds another point of compromise in the form of XSS;
\end{enumerate}

When using federated log-in for Native Apps, "best current practice requires that native apps MUST NOT use embedded user-agents to perform authorization requests" \cite{rfc8252}. This practice means that companies who have a mobile app or would consider having one in the future mustn't use the embedded flow.

For this thesis, we will only analyze the Redirect flow.

\subsection{Data Flow}

This section will analyze Dokobit Identity Gateway, redirect-based user flow. The general overview of which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:dokobit-identitygw-redirect}. We can group the authentication process into three parts: establishing a session with Dokobit, user authentication with an eID provider, and user information retrieval.

  \end{sequencediagram}
  \caption{Dokobit Identity Gateway - Redirect-based user flow \cite{dokobit-idgw-docs}}
  \label{fig:dokobit-identitygw-redirect}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Establishing a session with Dokobit}

When a user requests to authenticate, the company's back-end systems' first step is to establish a session with Dokobit Identity Gateway. To do this, a {POST} request must be made to the {/api/authenticate/create} endpoint. This response will contain the session identifier and the redirect URL. Users will have to go there to interface with their eID providers.

Sample HTTP request data can be seen in listing \ref{lst:dokobit-challenge-http}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Handling Dokobit session creation}, label={lst:dokobit-challenge-http}]
  Request:
  POST https://id-sandbox.dokobit.com/api/authentication/create?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
  {
      'return_url': 'https://id-sandbox.dokobit.com/example/success.php'
  }
  
  Response:
  {
    "status": "ok",
    "session_token": "02f922c9917231ea8acbbbcf63796924af548c801d75772f2b1701b413462c61",
    "url": "https://id-sandbox.dokobit.com/auth/02f922c9917231ea8acbbbcf63796924af548c801d75772f2b1701b413462c61",
    "expires_in": 3600
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{User authentication with an eID provider}

After the back-end successfully creates a session, they must redirect the user to the received endpoint. An easy way to accomplish that is to respond to the initial authentication request with HTTP status 302 - Found.

Most of the heavy lifting with authentication is delegated to this step and handled by Dokobit. The company's back-end systems should wait for the user to return after authenticating.

\paragraph{User information retrieval}

After the user returns after successful authentication, the back-end servers should make a {GET} request to {/api/authentication/session\_token/status} endpoint. The company can securely receive the user information via a backchannel.

Sample HTTP request data can be seen in listing \ref{lst:dokobit-handleremote-http}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Handling Dokobit session creation}, label={lst:dokobit-handleremote-http}]
  Request:
  GET https://id-sandbox.dokobit.com/api/authentication/SESSION_TOKEN/status?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
  
  Response:
  {
      "status": "ok",
      "certificate": { ... },
      "code": "30303039914",
      "country_code": "lt",
      "name": "DEMO",
      "surname": "SMART-ID",
      "authentication_method": "smartid",
      "date_authenticated": "2019-05-06T12:15:34+03:00"
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Trust Anchor}

Dokobit assumes the role of being the trust anchor. This role means that it also acts as a single point of failure. Should Dokobit become compromised, all applications using Dokobit will become susceptible to impersonation. On the flip side, there is only one system company developers need to implement, meaning it would be harder for adversaries to break into the system via external means.

Dokobit additionally provides the user's certificate from authentication, allowing companies to have local certificate validation to protect themselves if the identity provider gets compromised. This presence of the certificate makes this protocol potentially more secure than eeID.

\subsection{Pricing}

Dokobit is a commercial product, and therefore it has associated usage costs. In 2022, these costs are as seen in the table \ref{tab:dokobit-pricing}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Dokobit Identity Gateway pricing 2022}
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
    \bf{Plan} & \bf{Number of transactions} & \bf{Monthly fee} & \bf{Price per extra transaction} \\
    \hline
    1         & 700                         & 50 €             & 0,071 €                          \\
    \hline
    2         & 1 600                       & 100 €            & 0,063 €                          \\
    \hline
    3         & 5 000                       & 250 €            & 0,050 €                          \\
    \hline
    4         & 12 000                      & 500 €            & 0,042 €                          \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:dokobit-pricing}
\end{table}

Each pricing tier includes a specific number of transactions and adds a cost for each transaction exceeding it. For example, if the total amount of transactions is 200, the price will still be 50 €, as the number of transactions has not reached 700.

Assuming the company's users authenticate around 25 times per month, the monthly user price will be in the ballpark of 1-2 €.

\subsection{Security Requirements}

Of the three case studies analyzed in the thesis, Dokobit Identity Gateway was the only one that did not provide any request validation requirements to the relying party, only a single integration example \cite{dokobit-idgw-docs}. This flow, however, is very similar to the one used by the eeID service and will be analyzed by using the same framework \cite{ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}.

\paragraph{Communication channel}

The Dokobit identity gateway uses a secure communication channel, encrypted end-to-end using HTTPS. When the system is integrated correctly, malicious clients (or user agents) have no possible way of influencing any of the authentication parameters without triggering alarms when validating the request.

\subsubsection{Protocol's built-in security features}

\paragraph{Replay attacks}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identity Gateway will reject the second GET request with the session id.
\end{itemize}

The developer does not have to implement state management to verify that a given session token was used only once, as Dokobit will reject subsequent requests. Mitigation measures are sufficient.

\paragraph{Insufficient Redirect URI Validation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The adversary does not have any agency over redirect URI after authentication, as the {authorize} endpoint does not have any query parameters.
  \item The redirect\_url parameter when sending the initial request outlined in step 3 of the sequence diagram cannot be longer than 255 ASCII characters.
  \item The redirect URL is never validated on the Dokobit servers, as it was never registered as a client. Each redirect URL is generated for one-time use.
\end{itemize}

Attackers cannot influence the redirect URI. If companies use a static length redirect URI, the mitigation measures are sufficient.

\subparagraph{Credential Leakage via Referrer Headers}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Dokobit Identity Gateway does not include third-party resources (javascript, image, or other); therefore, it cannot leak the session token.
  \item The company is required not to have any third-party resources on the authentication and redirect pages.
\end{itemize}

Dokobit does not leak credentials via Referrer Headers (all resources used in their service are from their domain, as seen in Figure \ref{fig:dokobit-leakviareferrer}). The developers of relying parties must also not embed third-party resources in the critical authentication pages.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{dokobit/leakviareferrer}
  \caption{The Dokobit Identity Gateway does not use resources outside of their domain in the authentication flow}
  \label{fig:dokobit-leakviareferrer}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Credential Leakage via Browser History}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Session ids are stored in browser history (see figure \ref{fig:dokobit-leakviahistory}); however, they are single-use only and are immune to replay attacks.
\end{itemize}

The only thing adversaries could extract from the browser history is a used-up session-id, which does not provide much value with sufficient CSRF countermeasures.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{dokobit/leakviahistory}
  \caption{Session id is leaked inside the browser history when using Dokobit authentication}
  \label{fig:dokobit-leakviahistory}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Session Token Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery}

Adversaries would perform the injection and CSRF attacks identically.

\begin{itemize}
  \item The protocol protects from session token injection attacks by not allowing multiple requests to the {authorize} endpoint.
  \item It is impossible to steal a victim's or inject their session when the relying party has placed sufficient countermeasures.
\end{itemize}

The countermeasure against CSRF hinges on the fact that attackers do not know the final redirect URL. After the user agent returns to the callback URL, it may have a nonce value attached, generated during the initial request. If the query parameters match, the HTTP request is likely legitimate.

Dokobit provides \textbf{sufficient} tools to protect against CSRF attacks, and it is up to the relying party to integrate final mitigation measures.

\subparagraph{Clickjacking}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Dokobit auth page does not use Content-Security-Policy. However, it does use header X-Frame-Option: {SAMEORIGIN} (see figure \ref{fig:dokobit-responseheaders}).
  \item The {SAMEORIGIN} feature is used in conjunction with CORS to support embedded flow; however, it would be better if X-Frame-Option was set to {NONE}.
\end{itemize}

Mitigation measures are sufficient on almost all browsers released in the last ten years \cite{caniuse-xframeoptions}. The relying party should also place these headers on their log-in flow pages.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dokobit/frameoptions}
  \caption{Response headers browsers receive when opening the eeID service's login page}
  \label{fig:dokobit-responseheaders}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Validation requirements for the relying party}

In the previous section, we saw the security features of the protocol. The relying party should implement validation and reject requests for some features if those validations do not match. This section will contain all of the features the RP needs to address.

\paragraph{Misconfiguration Attacks}

\subparagraph{Incorrect URL specified}

The relying party must use the correct Dokobit Identity Gateway endpoints. For test environment the URL is \url{https://id-sandbox.dokobit.com}, and for production - \url{https://id.dokobit.com}. A connection with a malicious party could be established when using the incorrect URL.

Developers should make sure these values are not easily editable (such as placed in environment variables) by anyone. Best, they are hardcoded in the application.

\subparagraph{Weak TLS configuration}

TLS is the primary defense mechanism against MitM attacks when connecting to the Dokobit servers. WorkAuth's IT Ops team should ensure that the server does not trust any malicious CA.

\paragraph{Session Token Injection and Cross-Site Request Forgery}

Like in the eeID service, the primary validation user has to implement is protection against CSRF and code injection. Developers can bind the Dokobit session\_id to the user agent session.

\subparagraph{Attack description}

For reference to how the mitigation works, we will use the figure \ref{fig:dokobit-identitygw-redirect}. We will provide three examples for the countermeasure: without and with session binding, using a nonce.

Our attack exists right before the final redirect (right before step 5 in the figure \ref{fig:dokobit-identitygw-redirect}). Unlike in the case with eeID, this protocol has multiple places where an attacker can extract the session\_id as it is generated before the user is redirected and not after they complete the authentication process. Regardless, an attacker cares only about tokens that have been authenticated but not consumed, which puts us right before step 5.

\subparagraph{Attack \#1 - No binding}

If the application uses static or a predictable redirect URI, attackers can forge it to contain a session token inside the query parameters. Without user agent binding, it is trivial to establish a session.

\subparagraph{Attack \#2 - With user agent binding}

Before WorkAuth's server redirects the user agent to Dokobit's authorization endpoint, it first creates a cookie containing the session\_id in an encrypted form. This value will be used later.

We run the first attack per usual, interrupting the flow in the same place. When the attacker tries to authenticate, the server will successfully decrypt the cookie value. However, the server will fail to match the session\_id and detect the attack.

Because everything is bound to the same session\_id, this one cookie is sufficient to mitigate against both CSRF and code injection attacks.

\subparagraph{Attack \#3 - With user agent binding and unpredictable URL}

When generating a redirect URL, the application creates a secure fixed-length random nonce and appends it to the query parameters of the return URL. For example, if the return URL were \url{https://my.app/callback}, now it would be \url{https://my.app/callback?nonce=0c723a}. This nonce will be bound to the user agent session.

With a predictable URL, attackers can still perform session token injection attacks. Suppose the attackers convinced a victim to use their session and subsequently blocked their access to WorkAuth servers after successful authentication. In that case, they could use the predictable redirect URL to finish the authentication process.

Including a nonce or any other kind of randomness in the authentication process requires attackers to guess the final URL, preventing them from consuming the session token given sufficiently high randomness.

\subsection{Integration}

Unlike the eeID service, no libraries exist for Dokobit Identity Gateway, and users must manually integrate the flow. Fortunately, the integration is very straightforward.

The code snippets \ref{lst:dokobit-challenge} and \ref{lst:dokobit-handleremote} are akin to data flow in figure \ref{fig:dokobit-identitygw-redirect}. Numbers in comments directly correspond to the steps in the flow.

The first code block (listing \ref{lst:dokobit-challenge}) has three main parts:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item establish a session with Dokobit as described in listing \ref{lst:dokobit-challenge-http};
  \item append an \textbf{encrypted} session cookie which would bind the browser to that specific Dokobit session (this cookie stores the encrypted session\_token and nonce);
  \item redirect the user to the authorization endpoint;
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Handling Dokobit session creation}, label={lst:dokobit-challenge}]
  // [1] Login
  protected override async Task HandleChallengeAsync(AuthenticationProperties properties)
  {
      if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(properties.RedirectUri))
          properties.RedirectUri = OriginalPathBase + OriginalPath + Request.QueryString;

      // [2] Establish session with Dokobit
      var nonce = Convert.ToBase64String(RandomNumberGenerator.GetBytes(24)).TrimEnd('=').Replace('+', '-').Replace('/', '_');
      var body = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { return_url = QueryHelpers.AddQueryString(BuildRedirectUri(Options.CallbackPath), "nonce", nonce) });
      var response = await ExecuteRequestAsync(HttpMethod.Post, "/api/authentication/create", body);
      response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

      using var sessionResponse = await JsonDocument.ParseAsync(await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(Context.RequestAborted));
      var root = sessionResponse.RootElement;

      // Save session token and nonce to encrypted cookie properties
      properties.Items["session_token"] = root.GetString("session_token");
      properties.Items["nonce"] = nonce;

      Response.Cookies.Append(Options.StateCookie.Name!, Options.StateDataFormat.Protect(properties), Options.StateCookie.Build(Context, Clock.UtcNow));
      var redirectContext = new RedirectContext<DokobitOptions>(Context, Scheme, Options, properties, root.GetString("url")!);

      // [3] Redirect the user agent
      await Events.RedirectToAuthorizationEndpoint(redirectContext);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

After the user authenticates and returns, the next code block gets executed (listing \ref{lst:dokobit-handleremote}). This code performs request validation in addition to retrieving the user data:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item try to decrypt the cookie data - if decryption fails, it was likely tampered with, and the application cannot proceed with the authentication;
  \item try to obtain the session token from query parameters - it should always exist if the request was not tampered with;
  \item verify that the session\_token and nonce received from cookie and query parameters match - this prevents attackers from injecting session tokens;
  \item redeem the session\_token and receive user data as described in listing \ref{lst:dokobit-handleremote-http};
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Handling access token creation}, label={lst:dokobit-handleremote}]
  // [5] Callback
  protected override async Task<HandleRequestResult> HandleRemoteAuthenticateAsync()
  {
      // Decrypt the user agent session. If we fail here, it means that cookie was likely tampered with
      var properties = Options.StateDataFormat.Unprotect(Request.Cookies[Options.StateCookie.Name!]);
      if (properties == null)
          return HandleRequestResult.Fail("Invalid state");
  
      // Verify if session token and nonce received matches the one we initially saved
      var sessionToken = Request.Query["session_token"];
      if (properties.Items["session_token"] != sessionToken)
          return HandleRequestResult.Fail("Unexpected session_token received", properties);

      var nonce = Request.Query["nonce"];
      if (properties.Items["nonce"] != nonce)
          return HandleRequestResult.Fail("Unexpected nonce received", properties);
  
      // [6] Validation successful, obtain user identity
      var response = await ExecuteRequestAsync(HttpMethod.Get, $"/api/authentication/{sessionToken}/status");
      response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
  
      // Cleanup
      Response.Cookies.Delete(Options.StateCookie.Name!);
  
      // Establish an authenticated session
      await using var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync(Context.RequestAborted);
      using var user = await JsonDocument.ParseAsync(stream);
  
      var ticket = await CreateTicketAsync(new ClaimsIdentity(ClaimsIssuer), properties, user.RootElement);
      return HandleRequestResult.Success(ticket);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

After completing these steps, the final code will be resilient to CSRF and session token injection attacks.

\subsection{Discovered weaknesses}

\subsubsection{API key transferred via query parameters}

Dokobit Identity Gateway requires {relying parties} to send access tokens (API keys) via query parameters. When looking at the OAuth2.0 security best practices document \cite{ietf-oauth-security-topics-19}, under section 4.3.2, we can see that it may lead to Credential Leakage via Browser History.

No browser is involved when using the API key. However, it does not mean no traces are left anywhere, though. Companies frequently use application and network logging solutions to detect outages. Some logging solutions may be a bit overzealous when deciding what they should be allowed to log.

I will use .NET 6 Web API and Application Insights to provide a concrete example. All dependency calls will be tracked and logged to Application Insights log storage on MS Azure with an out-of-the-box configuration. The data of dependency calls include the request path + query. The inclusion of query parameters would make the application leak the Dokobit API key by accident to Azure services (see figure \ref{fig:dokobit-vuln-query}). Improper access rules (allowing developers to troubleshoot issues in the application) would allow people with access to read the API key.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{dokobit/vuln_appinsights}
  \caption{Example of data that would be sent to MS Azure Application Insights}
  \label{fig:dokobit-vuln-query}
\end{figure}

The impact of this attack appears to be insignificant, as it would only allow users to obtain the user's personal information, something an attacker could do with their own API key. The only other benefit would be sabotage by adding high usage costs to WorkAuth by rapidly forging requests and going around any rate limits the relying party may impose.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mar 02, 2022: Informed Dokobit CIRT about the exploit.
  \item Mar 13, 2022: Dokobit CIRT acknowledged the issue but decided against taking any action.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{CSRF on the authorize endpoint}

When performing a session token injection attack, relying parties can successfully protect themselves by binding the Dokobit's session token to the user agent session. Unfortunately, this does not prevent attackers from injecting their session tokens into victims' computers.

From the attacker's point of view, they can exploit this exploit can be achieved by performing these steps \cite{video-exploitdokobit}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Establish session with identity server and Dokobit;
  \item Trick the user into opening the link issued by Dokobit (phishing works);
  \item After the user authenticates, but before gets redirected, reload the page;
  \item If an attacker manages to achieve it in time, they receive that person's access;
\end{enumerate}

A video exists showing a live demonstration of how this attack appears for both attacker and victim \cite{video-exploitdokobit}.

\paragraph{The underlying issue}

At its core, this exploit is possible because of three issues: 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The attacker knows the response session token. Because all requests are correlated with the same session token, the attacker already knows the redirect URL.
  \item Nothing is binding the authentication and redirect processes.
  \item Requests automatically redirect the user to the final endpoint after authentication if the session token was not yet consumed.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{dokobit/vuln_csrf}
  \caption{Waterfall of Dokobit Smart-ID authentication}
  \label{fig:dokobit-vuln-csrf}
\end{figure}

We need to look at the waterfall diagram of Identity Gateway's requests (see Figure \ref{fig:dokobit-vuln-csrf}) to see why this attack works. The first request ({smartid}) starts a background task to authenticate with Smart-ID. Second and third requests ({status}) check on that background job and complete the request after it does. Notably, the checks are done with a delay, meaning there could be some amount of time (around one second) when the authentication process is finished, but the browser is not yet aware of it.

When a user refreshes the page, status checks are performed immediately, so if an attacker refreshed the page in the short one-second window, they would manage to steal the session. Ironically, if the WorkAuth developers were diligent enough to prevent CSRF attacks, in the server's eyes, the victim would be seen as an attacker, and their request would be rejected, giving even more time for attackers to exchange the token.

\paragraph{The fix}

On Apr 11, 2022, Dokobit developers fixed the issue by allowing only one HTTP request to the {authorize} endpoint. This fix prevents attackers from abusing the automatic redirect feature, eliminating this exploit. 

Figures \ref{fig:dokobit-vuln-csrf-fix-a} and \ref{fig:dokobit-vuln-csrf-fix-b} illustrate how the page looks after the fix was deployed.
